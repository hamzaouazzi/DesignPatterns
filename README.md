# DesignPatterns

## Introduction

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

### Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

* [Abstract Factory](#abstract-factory)
* [Builder](#builder)
* [Factory Method](#factory-method)
* [Prototype](#prototype)
* [Property](#property)
* [Singleton](#singleton)
* [Multiton](#multiton)
* [Object Pool](#object-pool)

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

* [Adapter](#adapter)
* [Bridge](#bridge)
* [Composite](#composite)
* [Decorator](#decorator)
* [Facade](#facade)
* [Flyweight](#flyweight)
* [Proxy](#proxy)
* [Service Locator](#service-locator)
* [Servant](#servant)
* [Event Aggregator](#event-aggregator)
 
### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilites between objects.

* [Chain of responsibility](#chain-of-responsibility)
* [Command](#command)
* [Interpreter](#interpreter)
* [Iterator](#iterator)
* [Mediator](#mediator)
* [Memento](#memento)
* [Observer](#observer)
* [State](#state)
* [Strategy](#strategy)
* [Template method](#template-method)
* [Visitor](#visitor)
* [Null Object](#null-object)
* [Intercepting Filter](#intercepting-filter)
* [Specification](#specification)
* [Dependency Injection](#dependency-injection)

### Concurrency Patterns

Concurrency patterns are those types of design patterns that deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm.

* [Double Checked Locking](#double-checked-locking)
* [Thread Pool](#thread-pool)

### Presentation Tier Patterns

Presentation Tier patterns are the top-most level of the application, this is concerned with translating tasks and results to something the user can understand.

* [Model-View-Controller](#model-view-controller)
* [Model-View-Presenter](#model-view-presenter)
* [Flux](#flux)

### Architectural Patterns

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.

* [Data Access Object](#dao)
* [Service Layer](#service-layer)

### Integration Patterns

Integration patterns are concerned with how software applications communicate and exchange data.

* [Tolerant Reader](#tolerant-reader)

### Idioms

A programming idiom is a means of expressing a recurring construct in one or more programming languages. Generally speaking, a programming idiom is an expression of a simple task, algorithm, or data structure that is not a built-in feature in the programming language being used, or, conversely, the use of an unusual or notable feature that is built into a programming language. What distinguishes idioms from patterns is generally the size, the idioms tend to be something small while the patterns are larger.

* [Execute Around](#execute-around)
* [Poison Pill](#poison-pill)
* [Callback](#callback)
* [Lazy Loading](#lazy-loading)
* [Double Dispatch](#double-dispatch)
* [Resource Acquisition Is Initialization](#resource-acquisition-is-initialization)
* [Private Class Data](#private-class-data)
